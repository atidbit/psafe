    PSafe Projectâ€™s goal is to serve as an intellectual repository for rigorous academic research on psychological safety. We are dedicated 
    to encouraging explorations across a wide spectrum of themes, including but not limited to the individual, interpersonal, organizational, 
    and societal dimensions of psychological safety. All submissions should follow the format and outline of the Psychological Safety, Advancement 
    and Review (PSAR) template, which can be downloaded [here].
