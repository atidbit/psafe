**Abstract** — _This paper explores the potential connections between the Indigenous Hawaiian practice of ho’oponopono and modern constructs of psychological safety in teams. Ho’oponopono is a cultural tradition focused on conflict resolution through collective responsibility, repentance, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Psychological safety describes a group climate characterized by interpersonal trust, inclusion, and risk-taking. At first glance, these concepts may seem unrelated. Analysis reveals notable alignments between ho’oponopono principles and psychological safety aims of mitigating fear, restoring trust, and enabling participation after setbacks. However, thoughtfulness is needed when translating communal ho’oponopono practices into contemporary organizational contexts. While ho’oponopono holds lessons for psychological safety in society, careful adaptation and more research is needed on implementation. With sensitivity, the harmony and foundation of ho’oponopono could meaningfully complement techniques for cooperation in organizations and larger societal issues_.

### INTRODUCTION

_Ho’oponopono_ is an ancient Hawaiian cultural practice focused on conflict resolution,
forgiveness, and relationship restoration (Moore, 2023). The practice itself involves accepting
responsibility, repenting, reconciling, and moving forward. Psychological safety on the other hand
describes a workplace climate where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and taking
interpersonal risks without fear of negative consequences (Edmondson, 1999). At first glance,
_ho’oponopono_ and psychological safety may seem unrelated. However, deeper analysis reveals
several interesting parallels and potential connections between this Indigenous approach and
modern concepts of team dynamics.

### HO’OPONOPONO’S FOCUS ON SHARED RESPONSIBILITY

A core tenet of _ho’oponopono_ is collectively accepting responsibility and accountability,
regardless of direct fault or blame, in order to make things right (Moore, 2023). This core tenet
aligns closely with psychological safety’s emphasis on moving away from finger-pointing when
failures occur and instead adopting a systemic mindset focused on overall improvement
(Edmondson, 1999). _Ho’oponopono_ at its core provides a process for acknowledging
interdependence and assuming shared responsibility for correcting relationship problems or lapses in 
judgment. When groups practice this principle of collective responsibility found in _ho’oponopono_ rather 
than identifying scapegoats, it can foster an environment where people feel psychologically safe to 
take risks, admit mistakes, and be vulnerable without fear of embarrassment or retaliation.

### PROMOTING REPENTANCE AND FORGIVENESS

After accepting shared responsibility, the next phase of _ho’oponopono_ traditionally involves 
reflection, discussion, confession, repentance, and making amends for harm caused 
(Austad & Rezentes, 2023; Moore, 2023). This reflects psychological safety research showing 
acts of forgiveness, repentance, and restitution can help restore trust and cooperation in groups
after transgressions, mistakes, or interpersonal conflicts take place 
(Bradley et al., 2012; Dirks et al., 2009; Frazier et al., 2017). When team members adopt a mindset 
of forgiveness rather than getting stuck in cycles of blaming and punishing individual errors, it can 
significantly promote psychological safety by reducing threats to status, belonging, and inclusion 
that often deter open participation (Edmondson, 1999). The _ho’oponopono process_ supplies a structured 
Indigenous framework to enable group repentance, making of amends, and forgiveness in the modern age.

### RECONCILING AND STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS

The final steps in _ho’oponopono_ traditionally involve prayer, open dialogue, ceremony, and other rituals 
aimed at reconciling relationships, restoring harmony, and moving forward (Austad & Rezentes, 2023). There 
are clear parallels that can be seen here with psychological safety’s emphasis and criteria related to 
maintaining a sustainable level of interpersonal respect, inclusion, and trust among group members (Edmondson, 1999). 
The relationship reconciliation practices found in _ho’oponopono_ could potentially help teams to heal disconnects, 
process conflict, and renew shared understanding after setbacks or rifts occur. This in turn supports psychological 
safety by proactively addressing and mending ruptures or problems before they escalate in ways that might 
otherwise erode individuals’ ability to comfortably be themselves or participate openly and honestly.

### POTENTIAL SHORTCOMINGS AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES

While there are evident conceptual connections between _ho’oponopono_ and constructs of psychological safety, it is 
important to recognize some potential limitations, risks, caveats, and implementation challenges. For instance, 
some contemporary practitioners and scholars have critiqued certain traditional elements of _ho’oponopono_ for placing 
too much emphasis on personal confession, repentance, and responsibility while failing to adequately address larger 
contextual, systemic, or structural factors enabling harm (Browne et al., 2009). Additionally, an overemphasis on 
harmony and reconciliation without proper balance could potentially discourage constructive debate, dissent, 
and accountability.

Because _ho’oponopono_ originated in the Indigenous Hawaiian cultural contexts of small, close-knit communities, 
adapting such communal practices to modern professional environments and organizational teams in Western cultural 
settings would likely require sensitivity and will pose some challenges (Browne et al., 2009). Leaders looking 
to incorporate insights from _ho'oponopono_ into the workplace will need to carefully consider how to adapt traditional 
practices to employees' existing cultural norms. Directly imposing foreign concepts could backfire if seen as 
inauthentic or forced. Instead, a thoughtful approach focused on organic integration is recommended, preserving 
core principles while aligning delivery to modern contexts.

### CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In conclusion, there are noteworthy conceptual and philosophical parallels that can be drawn between 
the traditional Hawaiian cultural practice of _ho’oponopono_ and modern research insights into team dynamics 
surrounding psychological safety. _Ho’oponopono’s_ principles of collective responsibility, repentance, 
forgiveness, reconciliation, and forward movement closely align with and complement psychological safety’s 
aims of reducing interpersonal fear, restoring trust, and enabling open participation after setbacks or 
conflict. However, for organizations to successfully translate insights from _ho’oponopono_ into the 
workplace, wise and careful implementation will be needed along with further research.

The discussion presented in this paper only briefly explores the potential connections between the 
Indigenous Hawaiian practice of _ho’oponopono_ and the modern construct of psychological safety in teams. 
Future studies are needed to establish best practices for respectfully and meaningfully adapting 
elements of _ho’oponopono_ in ways that boost psychological safety while still maintaining accountability 
and constructive disagreement in modern organizational contexts. With thoughtful and empirically 
grounded application, Indigenous concepts of harmony such as _ho’oponopono_ may hold valuable lessons 
to complement contemporary techniques for fostering workplace inclusion, openness, resilience, and 
cooperation. That said, our hopes in communicating the potential connections between the practice 
of _ho’oponopono_ and psychological safety in this paper is to stimulate interest in future research 
to explore this conceptual framework in an organizational context or society at large.
