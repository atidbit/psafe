<h2>Aim:</h2>

      The principal aim of "Psychological Safety, Advancement and Review" (PSAR) is 
      to foster a multidisciplinary discourse on the role, mechanisms, and 
      implications of psychological safety in both societal and organizational 
      contexts. The journal seeks to cultivate an enriched understanding of 
      how psychological safety, as a concept and a practice, can be harnessed 
      to build more resilient, inclusive, and effective systems in our modern world.

###Goals:

      Promotion of Scholarly Inquiry: PSAR aims to serve as an intellectual platform 
      for rigorous academic research on psychological safety. We are dedicated to encouraging 
      explorations across a wide spectrum of themes, including but not limited to the 
      individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal dimensions of psychological 
      safety. 
      
      Advancement of Theory and Practice: By drawing together research from diverse 
      theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches, the journal aspires to contribute 
      towards the advancement of theories pertaining to psychological safety, as well as 
      translate such theoretical understandings into practical strategies and recommendations 
      for real-world applications.

      Interdisciplinary Dialogue: Recognizing the value of holistic and integrative approaches 
      to understanding psychological safety, PSAR encourages contributions from an array of 
      disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, organizational behavior, management science, 
      and education, among others.
      
      Policy and Societal Impact: PSAR is committed to informing policy debates and social 
      practices related to psychological safety. Our goal is to provide evidence-based insights 
      that can inspire action towards the creation of more psychologically safe environments in 
      various societal sectors and organizations.
      
      Global and Diverse Perspectives: The journal aims to capture global and diverse perspectives 
      on psychological safety. We welcome contributions from researchers and practitioners across 
      the globe, believing that such inclusivity can significantly enrich our understanding and 
      application of psychological safety.
      
      Through these goals, "Psychological Safety, Advancement and Review" endeavors to be a leading voice 
      in shaping the future of psychological safety research and practice, facilitating dialogues 
      that inspire positive transformations in our societies and organizations.
